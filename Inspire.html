<h2>What Makes a Hero?</h2>
<p>A hero is someone you admire and aspire to be. This person is a role model in doing the right thing in life, which doesn't mean they are perfect, but they try to be their best every time. Anthony Edwards is my hero because he gives his best no matter what is going on. He is motivated and determined in anything he does!</p>
