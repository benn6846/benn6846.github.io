        <p>The internet is a great place to find humor.  This page will contain some funny things that might make you explode with laughter.</p>

        <h2>Funny Videos</h2>
        <p>Everytime I go to YouTube, I look for funny short videos or long videos that are funny. I like to watch funny videos that are animated in a funny way and tell story with humor. I really like this YouTube channel called Kaio which makes funny animation videos on one of my favorite podcasts. Below is the link to the funny video...</p>

        <h2><em>Social</em> Media Laughs</h2>
        <p>Instagram is another place to find amusing videos. I really love to see dark humor or simple funny reels in Instagram reels, I know that's not everyone's cup of tea but they are hilarious. I have attached a reel below that is very funny...</p>

        <h2>Written Jokes</h2>
        <p>If you aren't a person who likes funny videos or doesn't find them funny, I found pages of written jokes online that you can use or just read. I'm really into corny jokes because sometimes they are stupid but they can make you laugh. Because sometimes life doesn't have to be so serious, check this link down below...</p>
